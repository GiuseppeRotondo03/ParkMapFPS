#More about the process

I started by looking for references and creating a layout of the map seen from above, to better understand my ideas and how I could start.

Once I got to a good starting point I started with a rough blockout, with just the large shapes and no details, to better understand the feel and dimensions.

There are many differences between the layout and the blockout:

I tried to create "zones" with their own "identities". This way everything is more organised, sensible and easier for the player to remember. The player knows what "square" is and knows what "storage" or "market" is.

I'm really happy with how side B turned out, I think it's because I tested and iterated so much during the process.
